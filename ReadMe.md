DesktopAnalytics.net
===============================

[Segment.IO](http://segment.io) provides a nice <i>server-oriented</i> library in [Analytics.net](https://github.com/segmentio/Analytics.NET). This project is just one little class that wraps that to provide some standard behavior needed by <i>desktop</i> applications:

+ Supplies guids for user ids, saves that in a Settings file
+ Looks up the machine's external IP address and sends that along
+ Set $Browser to the Operating System Version (e.g. "Windows 8").
+ Auto events
+ First launch ("Create" to fit MixPanel's expectation)
+ Version Upgrade

## Install
    PM> Install-Package DesktopAnalytics

## Usage

### Initialization
```c#
using (new Analytics("mySegmentIOSecret"), userInfo)
{
    // other setup, and eventually
    Application.Run();
}
```

If you want to go beyond anonymous users, you can feed information about your user into DA like this:

```c#
var userInfo = new UserInfo()
    {
        FirstName = "John",
        LastName = "Smith",
        Email="john@example.com",
        UILanguageCode= "fr"
    };
userInfo.OtherProperties.Add("FavoriteColor","blue");

using (new Analytics("mySegmentIOSecret"), userInfo)
{
    // other setup, and eventually
    Application.Run();
}
```

If you have a way of letting users (or testers) disable tracking, pass that value as the second argument:

```c#
using (new Analytics("mySegmentIOSecret", allowTracking))
```

In this example, we use an environment variable so that testers and developers don't get counted:

```c#
#if DEBUG
    //always track if this is a debug built, but track to a different segment.io project
    using (new Analytics("(the secret for the debug version)"))

#else
    // if this is a release build, then allow an envinroment variable to be set to false
    // so that testers aren't generating false analytics
    string feedbackSetting = System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("FEEDBACK");

    var allowTracking = string.IsNullOrEmpty(feedbackSetting) || feedbackSetting.ToLower() == "yes" || feedbackSetting.ToLower() == "true";

    using (new Analytics("(the secret for the release version)", RegistrationDialog.GetAnalyticsUserInfo(), allowTracking))
    {
        // other setup, and eventually
        Application.Run();
    }

#endif
```

### Tracking

Wherever you want to register that something happened, call Track on the static object named "Analytics":

```c#
Analytics.Track("Create New Image");
```

If you have properties you need to record, add them by passing in a Dictionary<string, string>, like this:

```c#
Analytics.Track("Save PDF", new Dictionary<string, string>() {
        {"PageCount",  pageCount},
        {"Layout", "A4Landscape"}
    });
```

### Error Reporting

    Analytics.ReportException(error);

If you've also got LibPalaso in your app, hook up its ExceptionHandler like this:

    ExceptionHandler.AddDelegate((w,e) => DesktopAnalytics.Analytics.ReportException(e.Exception));


## Dependencies

The project is currently built for .net 4 client profile. If you get the solution, nuget should auto-restore the two dependencies when you build; they are not part of the source tree.

## Publishing

When changes are merged to master a github action will run dotnet pack and publish to Nuget. The publishing task can also be triggered by pushing a tag to the master branch.

## About Determining User's IP
DesktopAnalytics.net determines the user's ip by querying a website. Previously, it used ipecho.net, but that has gone down. It is currently using icanhazip.com. If that goes down too, we can change again. Your client can also use any other service you want by setting ````UrlThatReturnsExternalIpAddress````.
